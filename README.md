## Instagram Character Counter App

This is a project that seeks to make something a bit more useful than just being an exercise on javascript, CSS, and HTML.

An Instagram character counter app is something that I always need and make use of it.
By this time, as my knowledge in web development improves, I felt comfortable enough to make my own counter.

Main Features
(1) counter for all post types
(2) red alert whenever text overpass max limit (it shows the amount overpassed)
(3) modal with info about Instagram different text metrics. It doesn't open a new page.
