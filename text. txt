Different metrics explained
In the top left it will show the total characters typed out of the total Instagram caption character limit of 2200 characters. To the right of that it will countdown the total characters remaining. These metrics are on the top and in a bigger font because they are the most commonly used metrics.

Caption truncation: In an Instagram post, if the caption is longer than 125 characters, everything after 125 characters will be hidden and you will need to click "more" in order to read the rest of the caption. It's a good idea to get your most important point across and hook the reader in those first 125 characters.

Hashtag limit: Instagram has a hashtag limit of 30 hashtags per caption. Anything more than this will not be allowed. We hope you enjoy this Instagram hashtag counter feature!

DM limit: The Instagram DM character limit is 1000 characters. To access your DMs in Instagram click the paper plane icon in the top right corner. An Instagram DM character counter will help you keep your DMs under the limit.
